Project 1: Coronary risk factor screening in three rural communities at Africa. A study revealed that the major reversible risk factors hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and smoking, as well as 'minor' factors such as inactivity, obesity, hyperuricaemia, coronary-prone behaviour and the irreversible risk factors of chest pain, ischaemic changes on the ECG and a family history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), were exceedingly common (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6623218/).
Goal: Implement Machine Learning and data analysis techniques, such as feature extractions, visualization and principal component analysis to the collected dataset for coronary risk factors.
